# GHP Connector - Initial Specifications

## Overview

GHP Connector is an open-source Node.js library that provides a command-line interface to interact with GitHub Issues and Projects. It is written in pure TypeScript, compiled to JavaScript, and published as an npm package.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this library is to allow users and AI agents to interact with GitHub issues via the command line in a simple and readable way, avoiding the direct use of complex curl commands.

## Priority Features

In the first phase, we will focus primarily on GitHub issues-related functionalities:

- **Issue Creation**: Create new issues with title, description, labels, assignees, etc.
- **Issue Reading**: Get details of a specific issue or a list of issues with filtering
- **Issue Updates**: Modify properties of an existing issue
- **Comments Management**: Add, read, and delete comments on issues
- **Status Changes**: Change the status of an issue (open, closed)
- **Issue Listing**: Retrieve all issues from a repository with filtering options

## Technical Specifications

### General

- Written in TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Distributed as an npm package (both for global and local installation)
- Can be imported as a library in other Node.js projects

### Command Line Interface

- Clear and consistent command structure: `ghp [resource] [action] [options]`
- Support for common options like `--json` for output formatting
- Help commands and documentation built into the CLI
- Interactive mode for complex operations

### Configuration

- Local configuration file (e.g., `.ghprc.json` or `.ghprc.js`) to store default parameters like repository, project, etc.
- Environment-based configuration for different contexts (development, production)
- Secrets (GitHub access tokens, API keys) are provided through environment variables

### GitHub API Integration

- Uses the GitHub REST API v3 via Octokit
- Support for authentication with personal access tokens
- Rate limit handling and retry mechanisms
- Proper error handling with informative messages

### Output Formats

- Multiple output formats supported with the `--format` option:
  - Human-readable format optimized for terminal display (default)
  - JSON format for integration and automation
  - Text format for simple machine processing
  - Table and minimal formats (planned)
- Color-coding for terminal output with `--no-color` option to disable
- Standard return codes to facilitate integration with other tools

### Usability Features

- Intelligent defaults to minimize required parameters
- Configuration stored locally for repeated use
- Command history and favorites

## Future Developments

In later phases, we plan to add:

- GitHub Projects integration
- GitHub Actions integration
- Advanced filtering and search functionalities
- Batch operations for multiple issues
- Custom templates for issues and comments
- Webhook management

## Development Practices

- Semantic Versioning for releases
- Use of GitHub issues for bug and feature tracking
- Comprehensive documentation
- Unit tests to ensure code quality
- Complete API documentation
