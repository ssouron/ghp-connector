# Implementation Report: Ticket #21 - Advanced mocks for external dependencies

## Summary of Changes

We have implemented advanced mocks for external dependencies to enable isolated and reliable tests. This work was essential to ensure that unit tests do not depend on external services or local configurations.

## Installed Dependencies

- `jest-mock-extended`: Library for creating typed mocks with TypeScript

## Implemented Structure

```

## Implemented Mocks

### 1. File System Mocks (`fs-mock.ts`)

- **`mockFs()`**: Creates a simple mock of the fs module with default behaviors
- **`mockVirtualFs()`**: Creates an in-memory virtual file system for tests

These mocks avoid real file system access during tests, making them more stable and independent of the execution environment.

### 2. GitHub API Mocks (`octokit-mock.ts`)

- **`mockOctokit()`**: Creates a mock of the Octokit API for tests
- **`mockGitHubClient()`**: Creates a mock of our GitHubClient wrapper

These mocks eliminate dependency on GitHub services during tests, allowing faster tests without API quota risks.

### 3. Environment Variable Mocks (`env-mock.ts`)

- **`mockEnv()`**: Generic mock for environment variables
- **`mockGitHubEnv()`**: Preconfigured mock for GitHub variables
- **`mockCIEnv()`**: Preconfigured mock for CI environment

These mocks allow precise control of the test execution environment without affecting the real environment.

## Tests

The mocks have been tested via unit tests in `mocks.spec.ts` which verify their correct operation for various scenarios.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created to explain the use of mocks:

- How to create and use mocks
- Best practices for tests
- Code examples for different test scenarios
- Documentation for each type of mock

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Mocks are correctly typed with TypeScript  
✅ External dependencies can be reliably mocked  
✅ Mocks provide realistic behavior for test scenarios  
✅ Tests using mocks run consistently in different environments  
✅ The use of mocks is well-documented for future development  

## Conclusion

The implementation of advanced mocks provides a solid foundation for testing the GHP Connector application. It enables writing more reliable, faster tests that are independent of the execution environment or external services.
